# Gold prospectivity analysis using satellite hyperspectral imagery of Australia

## Motivation

Gold mineralisation is reported to be related to particular types of micas in areas surrounding gold deposits. Also, gold in known to be accumulated in ferric environments predominantly in association with Fe – sulphides. This manifestation of gold deposits on the Earth surface can be captured by hyperspectral satellite imagery. Since early 2000’s multiband spectral images were collected by ASTER satellite covering Australian continent with spatial resolution of 15, 30 and 90 mitres depending on the spectral band. This resolution was shown to be sufficient for capturing aforementioned types of mineralisation, which was validated by field surveys.

All the above makes the task of identifying potential gold prospects a good candidate for deep learning machinery where the features in satellite images related to gold mineralisation can be effeciently explored.

## Goals

- Identify potential application of Deep Learning (DL) techniques for mineral exploration
- Analyse, and process existing data on gold mine-sites
- Build a hyperspectral image library for training of DL models
- Build a DL network architecture for mixed numeric, categorical, and image data inputs
- Analyse the results and draw conclusions around applicability of DL for gold prospecting.
